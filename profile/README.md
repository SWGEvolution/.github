Welcome to SWG: Evolution!

I am announcing today that I am open sourcing the work I have put into SWG: Evolution in case I never get around to running a server. I do not want the work to go to waste.

I am bringing all my work back in line with the most recent version of source and I am starting by releasing my first patch that includes additional species that I first teased back in September 2021.

Some species have clipping issues and many of the new species have issues with helmets and there are some races with small clipping issues in other areas. I am collaborating with @Blood  at SWG: Expanded to work on these graphical fixes.

Special thanks to @Aconiteâ„  for helping me get started.
